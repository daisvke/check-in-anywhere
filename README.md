## Description

This project involves creating a single-page application website designed to serve as the virtual counterpart of the individual police report (fiche individuelle de police) required from clients in French hotels.
<br /><br />
The user can input the required information and provide a signature where necessary.<br />
Once completed, the document is sent to the establishment via email.<br />
This streamlined process allows clients to check in at the hotel more quickly, eliminating the need to fill out paperwork upon arrival.
<br /><br />
It has a React frontend and a PHP backend and uses redux as a state container.
