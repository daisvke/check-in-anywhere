## Description

This project is about creating a single page application website that would be used as the virtual version of the individual police report (fiche individuelle de police) asked to clients in french hotels.<br />

The user can input asked informations and sign where a signature is required.<br />
The document is then sent to the establishment by email.<br />
This way, the client can check in at the hotel much faster, without having to fill the document there.

It has a React frontend and a PHP backend.
